Each year tens of thousands of people run, walk and bike seven miles through the center
of San Francisco as part of the annual Bridge to Beach race. The race is joyful, absurd and loud -- just like Bay City.

As the organizers of Bridge to Beach, we are committed to preserving the culture of the event. But the safety of the participants is also of upmost importance. So this year, we are creating a brigade of volunteers to help be our eyes and ears on the ground during the event. We want to make sure we can provide help to all participants if they need it, but we can't be everywhere at once.

If you love Bridge to Beach as much as we do, please consider applying to be part of The Brigade.

## So What is The Brigade exactly?

The Brigade is a group of volunteer Bridge to Beach participants and bystanders who will send in periodic reports over text about the event during the course of the day. They will need to go through a short training program before the event on basic safety procedures. **We will not be looking for you to handle any incidents, we just want you to know how to report them.**

There will be two types of brigade members based on what kind of data connectivity they can expect to have on the day of the event. Cellular service can be inconsistent during Bridge to Beach so we want to guarantee that some of our brigade members will be able to communicate with us regardless of cell networks.
